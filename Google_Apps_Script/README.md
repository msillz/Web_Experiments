# Automatically create shared folders for students and TA's

This script is meant to be a substitute for AFS (Andrew File System) which was previously used by the university with great success.

Given a .csv of TA names and student names this script will automatically create all of the relevant files and set the shared permissions for the TAs to grade and keep students from viewing each other's work.
